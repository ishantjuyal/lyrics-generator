gettin stuck\\r\\nOn backroads at night\\r\\nAnd I was right there beside him all summer long\\r\\nAnd then the time we woke up to find that summer gone\\r\\nBut when you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think my favorite song\\r\\nThe one we danced to all night long\\r\\nThe moon like a spotlight on the lake\\r\\nWhen you think happiness\\r\\nI hope you think that little black dress\\r\\nThink of my head on your chest\\r\\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\\r\\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think of me\\r\\nSeptember saw a month of tears\\r\\nAnd thankin God that you werent here\\r\\nTo see me like that\\r\\nBut in a box beneath my bed\\r\\nIs a letter that you never read\\r\\nFrom three summers back\\r\\nIts hard not to find it all a little bittersweet\\r\\nAnd lookin back on all of that its nice to believe\\r\\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think my favorite song\\r\\nThe one we danced to all night long\\r\\nThe moon like a spotlight on the lake\\r\\nWhen you think happiness\\r\\nI hope you think that little black dress\\r\\nThink of my head on your chest\\r\\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\\r\\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think of me\\r\\nAnd Im back for the first time since then\\r\\nIm standin on your street\\r\\nAnd theres a letter left on your doorstep\\r\\nAnd the first thing that youll read is\\r\\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think my favorite song\\r\\nSomeday youll turn your radio on\\r\\nI hope it takes you back to that place\\r\\nWhen you think happiness\\r\\nI hope you think that little black dress\\r\\nThink of my head on your chest\\r\\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\\r\\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\\r\\nI hope you think of me\\r\\nOh think of me\\r\\nMmmm\\r\\nHe said the way my blue eyes shine\\r\\nPut those Georgia stars to shame that night\\r\\nI said Thats a lie\\r\\nState the obvious I didnt get my perfect fantasy\\r\\nI realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me\\r\\nSo go and tell

down\\r\\nEven though Im not the only one\\r\\nWho feels the way I do\\r\\nIm alone on my own and thats all I know\\r\\nIll be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on\\r\\nOh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world\\r\\nGot the radio on my old blue jeans\\r\\nAnd Im wearing my heart on my sleeve\\r\\nFeeling lucky today got the sunshine\\r\\nCould you tell me what more do I need\\r\\nAnd tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah\\r\\nBut thats OK\\r\\nIm alone on my own and thats all I know\\r\\nIll be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on\\r\\nOh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world\\r\\nMaybe Im just a girl on a mission\\r\\nBut Im ready to fly\\r\\nIm alone on my own and thats all I know\\r\\nIll be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on\\r\\nOh Im alone on my own and thats all I know\\r\\nOh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world\\r\\nOh Im just a girl\\r\\nOh Im just a girl oh oh\\r\\nOh Im just a girl\\r\\nYou have a way of coming easily to me\\r\\nAnd when you take you take the very best of me\\r\\nSo I start a fight cause I need to feel something\\r\\nAnd you do what you want cause Im not what you wanted\\r\\nOh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\\r\\nJust walk away no use defending words that you will never say\\r\\nAnd now that Im sitting here thinking it through\\r\\nIve never been anywhere cold as you\\r\\nYou put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray\\r\\nAnd I stood there loving you and wished them all away\\r\\nAnd you come away with a great little story\\r\\nOf a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you\\r\\nOh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\\r\\nJust walk away no use defending words that you will never say\\r\\nAnd now that Im sitting here thinking it through\\r\\nIve never been anywhere cold as you\\r\\nYou never did give a damn thing honey but I cried cried for you\\r\\nAnd I know you wouldnt have told nobody if I died died for you\\r\\nDied for you\\r\\nOh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\\r\\nEvery smile you fake is so condescending\\r\\nCounting all the scars you made\\r\\nAnd now that Im sitting here thinking it through\\r\\nIve never been anywhere cold as you\\r\\nI didnt know what I would find\\r\\nWhen I went looking for a reason I know\\r\\nI didnt read between the lines\\r\\nAnd baby Ive got nowhere to go\\r\\nI tried to take the road less traveled by\\r\\nBut nothing seems to work the first few times\\r\\nAm I right\\r\\nSo how can I ever try to be better\\r\\nNobody ever lets me in\\r\\nI can still see you this aint the best view\\r\\nOn the outside looking in\\r\\nIve been a lot of lonely places\\r\\nIve never been on the outside\\r\\nYou saw me there but never knew\\r\\nI would give it all up to be\\r\\nA part of this a part of you\\r\\nAnd now its all too late so you see\\r\\nYou couldve helped if you had wanted to\\r\\nBut no one notices until its too\\r\\nLate to do anything\\r\\nSo how can I ever try to be better\\r\\nNobody ever lets me in\\r\\nI can still see you this aint the best view\\r\\nOn the outside looking in\\r\\nIve been a lot of lonely places\\r\\nIve never been on the outside\\r\\nSo how can I ever try to be better\\r\\nNobody ever lets me in\\r\\nI can still see you this aint the best view\\r\\nOn the outside looking in\\r\\nIve been a lot of lonely places\\r\\nIve never been on the outside\\r\\nSeems the only one who doesnt see your beauty\\r\\nIs the face in the mirror looking back at you\\r\\nYou walk around here thinking youre not pretty\\r\\nBut thats not true cause I know you\\r\\nHold on\\r\\nBaby youre losing it\\r\\nThe waters high\\r\\nYoure jumping into it\\r\\nAnd letting go\\r\\nAnd no one knows\\r\\nThat you cry\\r\\nBut you dont tell anyone\\r\\nThat you might\\r\\nNot be the golden one\\r\\nAnd youre tied together with a smile\\r\\nBut youre coming undone\\r\\nI guess its true that love was all you wanted\\r\\nCause youre giving it away like its extra change\\r\\nHoping it will end up in his pocket\\r\\nBut he leaves you out like a penny in the rain\\r\\nOh cause its not his price to pay\\r\\nNot his price to pay\\r\\nHold on\\r\\nBaby youre losing it\\r\\nThe waters high\\r\\nYoure jumping into it\\r\\nAnd letting go\\r\\nAnd no one knows\\r\\nThat you cry\\r\\nBut you dont tell anyone\\r\\nThat you might\\r\\nNot be the golden one\\r\\nAnd youre tied together with a smile\\r\\nBut youre coming undone\\r\\nHold on\\r\\nBaby youre losing it\\r\\nThe waters high\\r\\nYoure jumping into it\\r\\nAnd letting go\\r\\nAnd no one knows\\r\\nThat you cry\\r\\nBut you dont tell anyone\\r\\nThat you might\\r\\nNot be the golden one\\r\\nAnd youre tied together with a smile\\r\\nBut youre coming undone\\r\\nYoure tied together with a smile\\r\\nBut youre coming undone oh\\r\\nGoodbye baby\\r\\nWith a smile baby baby\\r\\nCorys eyes are like a jungle\\r\\nHe smiles its like the radio\\r\\nHe whispers songs into my window\\r\\nIn words that nobody knows\\r\\nThese pretty girls on every corner\\r\\nThey watch him as hes walking home\\r\\nSaying Does he know\\r\\nWill you ever know\\r\\nYoure beautiful\\r\\nEvery little piece love\\r\\nAnd dont you know\\r\\nYoure really gonna be someone\\r\\nAsk anyone\\r\\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\\r\\nI hope your life will lead you back to my door\\r\\nOh but if it dont\\r\\nStay beautiful\\r\\nCory finds another way to be\\r\\nThe highlight of my day\\r\\nIm taking pictures in my mind\\r\\nSo I can save them for a rainy day\\r\\nIts hard to make a conversation\\r\\nWhen hes taking my breath away\\r\\nI should say hey by the way\\r\\nYoure beautiful\\r\\nEvery little piece love\\r\\nAnd dont you know\\r\\nYoure really gonna be someone\\r\\nAsk anyone\\r\\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\\r\\nI hope your life will lead you back to my door\\r\\nOh but if it dont\\r\\nStay beautiful\\r\\nIf you and I are a story\\r\\nThat never gets told\\r\\nIf what you are is a daydream\\r\\nIll never get to hold\\r\\nAt least youll know\\r\\nYoure beautiful\\r\\nEvery little piece love\\r\\nAnd dont you know\\r\\nYoure really gonna be someone\\r\\nAsk anyone\\r\\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\\r\\nI hope your life will lead you back to my front door\\r\\nOh but if it dont\\r\\nWill you stay\\r\\nBeautiful beautiful beautiful\\r\\nBeautiful beautiful beautiful\\r\\nLa la la\\r\\nOh oh oh oh\\r\\nOh but if it dont\\r\\nStay beautiful\\r\\nStay

feels wrong\\r\\nYou say that youd take it all back given one chance\\r\\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said Yes\\r\\nYou shouldve said No you shouldve gone home\\r\\nYou shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go\\r\\nYou shouldve know that word bout what you did with her\\r\\nGet back to me get back to me\\r\\nAnd I shouldve been there in the back of your mind\\r\\nI shouldnt be asking myself Why\\r\\nYou shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet\\r\\nYou shouldve said no baby and you might still have me\\r\\nYou can see that Ive been crying\\r\\nBaby you know all the right things to say\\r\\nBut do you honestly expect me to believe\\r\\nWe could ever be the same\\r\\nYou say that the past is the past you need one chance\\r\\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said Yes\\r\\nYou shouldve said No you shouldve gone home\\r\\nYou shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go\\r\\nYou shouldve know that word bout what you did with her\\r\\nGet back to me get back to me\\r\\nAnd I shouldve been there in the back of your mind\\r\\nI shouldnt be asking myself Why\\r\\nYou shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet\\r\\nYou shouldve said no baby and you might still have me\\r\\nI cant resist\\r\\nBefore you go tell me this\\r\\nWas it worth it\\r\\nWas she worth this\\r\\nNo no no no\\r\\nYou shouldve said No you shouldve gone home\\r\\nYou shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go\\r\\nYou shouldve know that word bout what you did with her\\r\\nGet back to me get back to me\\r\\nAnd I shouldve been there in the back of your mind\\r\\nI shouldnt be asking myself Why\\r\\nYou shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet\\r\\nYou shouldve said no baby and you might still have me\\r\\nShe said I was seven and you were nine\\r\\nI looked at you like the stars that shined\\r\\nIn the sky the pretty lights\\r\\nAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of us\\r\\nGrowing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled\\r\\nAnd rolled their eyes and said oh my my my\\r\\nTake me back to the house in the backyard tree\\r\\nSaid youd beat me up you were bigger than me\\r\\nYou never did you never did\\r\\nTake me back when our world was one block wide\\r\\nI dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried\\r\\nJust two kids you and I\\r\\nOh my my my my\\r\\nWell I was sixteen when suddenly\\r\\nI wasnt that little girl you used to see\\r\\nBut your eyes still shined like pretty lights\\r\\nAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of us\\r\\nThey never believed wed really fall in love\\r\\nAnd our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes\\r\\nAnd said oh my my my\\r\\nTake me back to the creek beds we turned up\\r\\nTwo AM riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me\\r\\nTake me back to the time we had our very first fight\\r\\nThe slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight\\r\\nYou stayed outside till the morning light\\r\\nOh my my my my\\r\\nA few years had gone and come around\\r\\nWe were sitting at our favorite spot in town\\r\\nAnd you looked at me got down on one knee\\r\\nTake me back to the time when we walked down the aisle\\r\\nOur whole town came and our mamas cried\\r\\nYou said I do and I did too\\r\\nTake me home where we met so many years before\\r\\nWell rock our babies on that very front porch\\r\\nAfter all this time you and I\\r\\nIll be eightyseven youll be eightynine\\r\\nIll still look at you like the stars that shine\\r\\nIn the sky oh my my my\\r\\nI was riding shotgun with my hair undone\\r\\nIn the front seat of his car\\r\\nHes got a onehand feel on the steering wheel\\r\\nThe other on my heart\\r\\nI look around turn the radio down\\r\\nHe says Baby is something wrong\\r\\nI say Nothing I was just thinking\\r\\nHow we dont have a song\\r\\nAnd he says\\r\\nOur song is the slamming screen door\\r\\nSneakin out late tapping on your window\\r\\nWhen were on the phone and you talk real slow\\r\\nCause its late and your mama dont know\\r\\nOur song is the way you laugh\\r\\nThe first date Man I didnt kiss her and I should have\\r\\nAnd when I got home fore I said amen\\r\\nAsking God if he could play it again\\r\\nI was walking up the front porch steps\\r\\nAfter everything that day\\r\\nHad gone all wrong and been trampled on\\r\\nAnd lost and thrown away\\r\\nGot to the hallway well on my way\\r\\nTo my lovin bed\\r\\nI almost didnt notice all the roses\\r\\nAnd the note that said\\r\\nOur song is the slamming screen door\\r\\nSneakin out late tapping on your window\\r\\nWhen were on the phone and you talk real slow\\r\\nCause its late and your mama dont know\\r\\nOur song is the way you laugh\\r\\nThe first date Man I didnt kiss her and I should have\\r\\nAnd when I got home fore I said amen\\r\\nAsking God if he could play it again\\r\\nIve heard every album listened to the radio\\r\\nWaited for something to come along\\r\\nThat was as good as our song\\r\\nCause our song is the slamming screen door\\r\\nSneakin out late tapping on his window\\r\\nWhen were on the phone and he talks real slow\\r\\nCause its late and his mama dont know\\r\\nOur song is the way he laughs\\r\\nThe first date Man I didnt kiss him and I should have\\r\\nAnd when I got home fore I said amen\\r\\nAsking God if he could play it again\\r\\nPlay it again\\r\\nI was riding shotgun with my hair undone\\r\\nIn the front seat of his car\\r\\nI grabbed a pen and an old napkin\\r\\nAnd I wrote down our song\\r\\nFriday night beneath the stars\\r\\nIn a field behind your yard\\r\\nYou and I are painting pictures in the sky\\r\\nAnd sometimes we dont say a thing\\r\\nJust listen to the crickets sing\\r\\nEverything I need is right here by my side\\r\\nAnd I know everything about you\\r\\nI dont wanna live without you\\r\\nIm only up when youre not down\\r\\nDont wanna fly if youre still on the ground\\r\\nIts like no matter what I do\\r\\nWell you drive me crazy half the time\\r\\nThe other half Im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true\\r\\nAnd Im only me when Im with you\\r\\nJust a small town boy and girl\\r\\nLiving in a crazy world\\r\\nTrying to figure out what is and isnt true\\r\\nAnd I dont try to hide my tears\\r\\nThe secrets or my deepest fears\\r\\nThrough it all nobody gets me like you do\\r\\nAnd you know everything about me\\r\\nYou say that you cant live without me\\r\\nIm only up when youre not down\\r\\nDont wanna fly if youre still on the ground\\r\\nIts like no matter what I do\\r\\nWell you drive me crazy half the time\\r\\nThe other half Im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true\\r\\nAnd Im only me when Im with you\\r\\nWhen Im with anybody else its so hard to be myself\\r\\nOnly you can tell\\r\\nThat Im only up when youre not down\\r\\nDont wanna fly if youre still on the ground\\r\\nIts like no matter what I do\\r\\nWell you drive me crazy half the time\\r\\nThe other half Im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true\\r\\nAnd Im only me\\r\\nWho I wanna be\\r\\nWell Im only me when Im with you\\r\\nWith you\\r\\nUh huh\\r\\nYeah\\r\\nShe cant see the way your eyes\\r\\nLight up when you smile\\r\\nShell never notice how you stop and stare\\r\\nWhenever she walks by\\r\\nAnd you cant see me wanting you the way you want her\\r\\nBut you are everything to me\\r\\nI just want to show you\\r\\nShe dont even know you\\r\\nShes never going to love you like I want to\\r\\nAnd you just see right through me\\r\\nIf you only knew me\\r\\nWe could be a beautiful\\r\\nMiracle\\r\\nUnbelievable\\r\\nInstead of just invisible\\r\\nTheres a fire inside of you\\r\\nThat cant help but shine through\\r\\nShes never going to see the light\\r\\nNo matter

while\\r\\nTry and stay out of everybodys way\\r\\nIts your freshman year and youre going to be here\\r\\nFor the next four years in this town\\r\\nHoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\\r\\nYou know I havent seen you around before\\r\\nBecause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\\r\\nYoure going to believe them\\r\\nAnd when youre fifteen feeling like theres nothing to figure out\\r\\nWell count to ten take it in\\r\\nThis is life before you know who youre going to be\\r\\nFifteen\\r\\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\\r\\nAnd soon enough youre best friends\\r\\nLaughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool\\r\\nWell be outta here as soon as we can\\r\\nAnd then youre on your very first date and hes got a car\\r\\nAnd youre feeling like flying\\r\\nAnd your mommas waiting up and youre thinking hes the one\\r\\nAnd youre dancing round your room when the night ends\\r\\nWhen the night ends\\r\\nBecause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\\r\\nYoure going to believe them\\r\\nWhen youre fifteen and your first kiss\\r\\nMakes your head spin round\\r\\nBut in your life youll do things greater than\\r\\nDating the boy on the football team\\r\\nBut I didnt know it at fifteen\\r\\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\\r\\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\\r\\nBack then I swore I was going to marry him someday\\r\\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\\r\\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had to a boy\\r\\nWho changed his mind and we both cried\\r\\nBecause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\\r\\nYoure going to believe them\\r\\nAnd when youre fifteen dont forget to look before you fall\\r\\nIve found time can heal most anything\\r\\nAnd you just might find who youre supposed to be\\r\\nI didnt know who I was supposed to be at fifteen\\r\\nLa la la la la la la la la la\\r\\nLa la la la la la la la la la\\r\\nLa la la

paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me\\r\\nIts the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs\\r\\nAnd Daddys smart\\r\\nAnd youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world\\r\\nAnd now I know why all the trees change in the fall\\r\\nI know you were on my side even when I was wrong\\r\\nAnd I love you for giving me your eyes\\r\\nFor staying back and watching me shine\\r\\nAnd I didnt know if you knew so Im taking this chance to say\\r\\nThat I had the best day with you today\\r\\nAnd its a sad picture the final blow hits you\\r\\nSomebody else gets what you wanted again and\\r\\nYou know its all the same another time and place\\r\\nRepeating history and youre getting sick of it\\r\\nBut I believe in whatever you do\\r\\nAnd Ill do anything to see it through\\r\\nBecause these things will change\\r\\nCan you feel it now\\r\\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\\r\\nThis revolution the time will come\\r\\nFor us to finally

never looked back\\r\\nI was a flight risk with a fear of falling\\r\\nWondering why we bother with love if it never lasts\\r\\nI say Can you believe it\\r\\nAs were lying on the couch\\r\\nThe moment I could see it\\r\\nYes yes I can see it now\\r\\nDo you remember we were sitting there by the water\\r\\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\\r\\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\\r\\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine\\r\\nFlash forward and were taking on the world together\\r\\nAnd theres a drawer of my things at your place\\r\\nYou learn my secrets and figure out why Im guarded\\r\\nYou say well never make my parents mistakes\\r\\nBut we got bills to pay\\r\\nWe got nothing figured out\\r\\nWhen it was hard to take\\r\\nYes yes\\r\\nThis is what I thought about\\r\\nDo you remember we were sitting there by the water\\r\\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\\r\\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\\r\\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine\\r\\nDo you remember all the city lights on the water\\r\\nYou saw me start to believe for the first time\\r\\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\\r\\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine\\r\\nAnd I remember that fight 230 AM\\r\\nAs everything was slipping right out of our hands\\r\\nI ran out crying and you followed me out into the street\\r\\nBraced myself for the goodbye\\r\\nCause thats all Ive ever known\\r\\nThen you took me by surprise\\r\\nYou said Ill never leave you alone\\r\\nYou said I remember how we felt sitting by the water\\r\\nAnd every time I look at you its like the first time\\r\\nI fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter\\r\\nShe is the best thing thats ever been mine\\r\\nHold on make it

cards\\r\\nYoure the kind of reckless\\r\\nThat should send me running\\r\\nBut I kinda know that I wont get far\\r\\nAnd you stood there in front of me\\r\\nJust close enough to touch\\r\\nClose enough to hope you couldnt see\\r\\nWhat I was thinking of\\r\\nDrop everything now\\r\\nMeet me in the pouring rain\\r\\nKiss me on the sidewalk\\r\\nTake away the pain\\r\\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nGet me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down\\r\\nGive me something thatll haunt me when youre not around\\r\\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nMy mind forgets to remind me\\r\\nYoure a bad idea\\r\\nYou touch me once and its really something\\r\\nYou find Im even better than you imagined I would be\\r\\nIm on my guard for the rest of the world\\r\\nBut with you I know its no good\\r\\nAnd I could wait patiently but I really wish you would\\r\\nDrop everything now\\r\\nMeet me in the pouring rain\\r\\nKiss me on the sidewalk\\r\\nTake away the pain\\r\\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nGet me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down\\r\\nGive me something thatll haunt me when youre not around\\r\\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nI run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild\\r\\nJust keep on keeping your eyes on me its just wrong enough to make it feel right\\r\\nAnd lead me up the staircase\\r\\nWont you whisper soft and slow\\r\\nIm captivated by you baby like a firework show\\r\\nDrop everything now\\r\\nMeet me in the pouring rain\\r\\nKiss me on the sidewalk\\r\\nTake away the pain\\r\\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\r\\nGet me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down\\r\\nGive me something thatll haunt me when youre not

family\\r\\nI havent seen them in a while\\r\\nYouve been good busier than ever\\r\\nWe small talk work and the weather\\r\\nYour guard is up and I know why\\r\\nCause the last time you saw me\\r\\nIs still burned in the back of your mind\\r\\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die\\r\\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\\r\\nStanding in front of you saying Im sorry for that night\\r\\nAnd Id go back to December all the time\\r\\nIt turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you\\r\\nWishing Id realized what I had when you were mine\\r\\nId go back to December turn around and make it alright\\r\\nI go back to December all the time\\r\\nThese days I havent been sleeping\\r\\nStaying up playing back myself leaving\\r\\nWhen your birthday passed and I didnt call\\r\\nAnd I think about summer all the beautiful times\\r\\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side and\\r\\nRealized I loved you in the fall\\r\\nAnd then the cold came\\r\\nThe dark days when fear crept into my mind\\r\\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye\\r\\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\\r\\nStanding in front of you saying Im sorry for that night\\r\\nAnd Id go back to December all the time\\r\\nIt turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you\\r\\nWishing Id realized what I had when you were mine\\r\\nId go back to December turn around and change my own mind\\r\\nI go back to December all the time\\r\\nI miss your tan skin your sweet smile so good to me so right\\r\\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\\r\\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\\r\\nMaybe this is wishful thinking\\r\\nProbably mindless dreaming\\r\\nBut if we loved again I swear Id love you right\\r\\nId go back in time and change it but I cant\\r\\nSo if the chain is on your door I understand\\r\\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\\r\\nStanding in front of you saying Im sorry for that night\\r\\nAnd Id go back to December\\r\\nIt turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you\\r\\nWishing Id realized what I had when you were mine\\r\\nId go back to December turn around and make it alright\\r\\nId go back to December turn around and change my own mind\\r\\nI go back to December all the time\\r\\nAll the time\\r\\nI am not the kind of girl\\r\\nWho should be rudely barging in\\r\\nOn a white veil occasion\\r\\nBut you are not the kind of boy\\r\\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\\r\\nI sneak in and see your friends\\r\\nAnd her snotty little family\\r\\nAll dressed in pastel\\r\\nAnd she is yelling at a bridesmaid\\r\\nSomewhere back inside a room\\r\\nWearing a gown shaped like a pastry\\r\\nThis is surely not\\r\\nWhat you thought it would be\\r\\nI lose myself in a daydream\\r\\nWhere I stand and say\\r\\nDont say yes run away now\\r\\nIll meet you when youre out\\r\\nOf the church at the back door\\r\\nDont wait or say a single vow\\r\\nYou need to hear me out\\r\\nAnd they said speak now\\r\\nFond gestures are exchanged\\r\\nAnd the organ starts to play\\r\\nA song that sounds like a death march\\r\\nAnd I am hiding in the curtains\\r\\nIt seems that I was uninvited\\r\\nBy your lovely bridetobe\\r\\nShe floats down the aisle\\r\\nLike a pageant queen\\r\\nBut I know you wish it was me\\r\\nYou wish it was me Dont you\\r\\nDont say yes run away now\\r\\nIll meet you when youre out\\r\\nOf the church at the back door\\r\\nDont wait or say a single vow\\r\\nYou need to hear me out\\r\\nAnd they said speak now\\r\\nDont say yes run away now\\r\\nIll meet you when youre out\\r\\nOf the church at the back door\\r\\nDont wait or say a single vow\\r\\nYou need to hear me out\\r\\nAnd they said speak now\\r\\nOoh ladadada oh\\r\\nOoh ooh\\r\\nSay a single vow\\r\\nI hear the preacher say\\r\\nSpeak now or forever hold your peace\\r\\nTheres the silence theres my last chance\\r\\nI stand up with shaking hands all eyes on me\\r\\nHorrified looks from everyone in the room\\r\\nBut Im only looking at you\\r\\nI am not the kind of girl\\r\\nWho should be rudely barging in\\r\\nOn a white veil occasion\\r\\nBut you are not the kind of boy\\r\\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\\r\\nHehe\\r\\nDont say yes run away now\\r\\nIll meet you when youre out\\r\\nOf the church at the back door\\r\\nDont wait or say a single vow\\r\\nYou need to hear me out\\r\\nAnd they said speak now\\r\\nAnd you say\\r\\nLets run away now\\r\\nIll meet you when\\r\\nIm out of my tux at the back door\\r\\nBaby I didnt say my vows\\r\\nSo glad you were around when they said\\r\\nSpeak now\\r\\nLong were the nights when\\r\\nMy days once revolved around you\\r\\nCounting my footsteps\\r\\nPraying the floor wont fall through again\\r\\nMy mother accused me of losing my mind\\r\\nBut I swore I was fine\\r\\nYou paint me a blue sky\\r\\nThen go back and turn it to rain\\r\\nAnd I lived in your chess game\\r\\nBut you changed the rules everyday\\r\\nWonderin which version of you I might get on the phone tonight\\r\\nWell I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why\\r\\nDear John I see it all now that youre gone\\r\\nDont you think I was too young to be messed with\\r\\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\\r\\nI shoulda known\\r\\nWell maybe its me\\r\\nAnd my blind optimism to blame\\r\\nOr maybe its you and your sick need\\r\\nTo give love and take it away\\r\\nAnd youll add my name to your long list of traitors\\r\\nWho dont understand\\r\\nAnd I look back in regret how I ignored when they said\\r\\nRun as fast as you can\\r\\nDear John I see it all now that youre gone\\r\\nDont you think I was too young to be messed with\\r\\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\\r\\nDear John I see it all now it was wrong\\r\\nDont you think nineteens too young\\r\\nTo be played by your dark twisted games\\r\\nWhen I loved you so\\r\\nI shoulda known\\r\\nYou are an expert at sorry\\r\\nAnd keeping the lines blurry\\r\\nNever impressed by me acing your tests\\r\\nAll the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes\\r\\nCause you burned them out\\r\\nBut I took your matches\\r\\nBefore fire could catch me\\r\\nSo dont look now\\r\\nIm shining like fireworks\\r\\nOver your sad empty town yeah\\r\\nOh oh oh oh oh oh\\r\\nDear John I see it all now that youre gone\\r\\nDont you think I was too young to be messed with\\r\\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\\r\\nI see it all now that youre gone\\r\\nDont you think I was too young to be messed with\\r\\nThe girl in the dress\\r\\nWrote you a song you shoulda known\\r\\nYou shoulda known\\r\\nDont you think I was too young\\r\\nYou shoulda known\\r\\nYou with your words like knives\\r\\nAnd swords and weapons that you use against me\\r\\nYou have knocked me off my feet again\\r\\nGot me feeling like Im nothing\\r\\nYou with your voice like nails on a chalkboard\\r\\nCalling me out when Im wounded\\r\\nYou picking on the weaker man\\r\\nBut you can take me down with just one single blow\\r\\nBut you dont know what you dont know\\r\\nSomeday Ill be living in a big old city\\r\\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nSomeday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me\\r\\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean\\r\\nYou with your switching sides\\r\\nAnd your wildfire lies and your humiliation\\r\\nYou have pointed out my flaws again\\r\\nAs if I dont already see them\\r\\nI walk with my head down trying to block you out\\r\\nCause Ill never impress you\\r\\nI just want to feel okay again\\r\\nI bet you got pushed around\\r\\nSomebody made you cold\\r\\nBut the cycle ends right now\\r\\nCause you cant lead me down that road\\r\\nAnd you dont know what you dont know\\r\\nSomeday Ill be living in a big old city\\r\\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nSomeday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me\\r\\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean\\r\\nAnd I can see you years from now in a bar\\r\\nTalking over a football game\\r\\nWith that same big loud opinion\\r\\nBut nobodys listening\\r\\nWashed up and ranting about the same old bitter things\\r\\nDrunk and grumbling on about how I cant sing\\r\\nBut all you are is mean\\r\\nAll you are is mean\\r\\nAnd a liar and pathetic and alone in life\\r\\nAnd mean and mean and mean and mean\\r\\nBut someday Ill be living in a big old city\\r\\nAnd all youre ever going to be is mean yeah\\r\\nSomeday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me\\r\\nAnd all youre ever going to be is mean\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean\\r\\nSomeday Ill be living in a big old city\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean\\r\\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean\\r\\nSomeday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean\\r\\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\\r\\nWhy you gotta be so mean\\r\\nI used to think one day wed tell the story of us\\r\\nHow we met\\r\\nAnd the sparks flew instantly\\r\\nAnd people would say theyre the lucky ones\\r\\nI used to know my place was a spot next to you\\r\\nNow Im searching the room for an empty seat\\r\\nCause lately I dont even know what page youre on\\r\\nOh a simple complication\\r\\nMiscommunications lead to fallout\\r\\nSo many things that I wish you knew\\r\\nSo many walls up that I cant break through\\r\\nNow Im standing alone in a crowded room\\r\\nAnd were not speaking\\r\\nAnd Im dying to know\\r\\nIs it killing you like its killing me\\r\\nYeah I dont know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down\\r\\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\\r\\nNext chapter\\r\\nHowd we end up this way\\r\\nSee me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy\\r\\nAnd youre doing your best to avoid me\\r\\nIm starting to think one day Ill tell the story of us\\r\\nOf how I was losing my mind when I saw you here\\r\\nBut you held your pride like you should have held me\\r\\nOh Im scared to see the ending\\r\\nWhy are we pretending this is nothing\\r\\nId tell you I miss you but I dont know how\\r\\nIve never heard silence quite this loud\\r\\nNow Im standing alone in a crowded room\\r\\nAnd were not speaking\\r\\nAnd Im dying to know\\r\\nIs it killing you like its killing me\\r\\nYeah and I dont know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down\\r\\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\\r\\nThis is looking like a contest\\r\\nOf who can act like they care less\\r\\nBut I liked it better when you were on my side\\r\\nThe battles in your hands now\\r\\nBut I would lay my armor down\\r\\nIf you say youd rather love than fight\\r\\nSo many things that you wish I knew\\r\\nBut the story of us might be ending soon\\r\\nNow Im standing alone in a crowded room\\r\\nAnd were not speaking\\r\\nAnd Im dying to know\\r\\nIs it killing you like its killing me\\r\\nYeah and I dont know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke

met\\r\\nAcross the room your silhouette\\r\\nStarts to make its way to me\\r\\nThe playful conversation starts\\r\\nCounter all your quick remarks\\r\\nLike passing notes in secrecy\\r\\nAnd it was\\r\\nEnchanting to meet you\\r\\nAll I can say is\\r\\nI was enchanted to meet you\\r\\nThis night is sparkling\\r\\nDont you let it go\\r\\nIm wonderstruck\\r\\nBlushing all the way home\\r\\nIll

name with things\\r\\nBut sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know\\r\\nOr pushing people down to get you where you wanna go\\r\\nOh they didnt teach you that in prep school so its up to

line\\r\\nI have known it all this time\\r\\nNever ever thought Id see it break\\r\\nNever thought Id see it\\r\\nI still remember the look on your face\\r\\nLit through the darkness at 158\\r\\nThe words that you whispered\\r\\nFor just us to know\\r\\nYou told me you loved me\\r\\nSo why did you go away\\r\\nAway\\r\\nI do recall now the smell of the rain\\r\\nFresh on the pavement\\r\\nI ran off the plane\\r\\nThat July 9th\\r\\nThe beat of your heart\\r\\nIt jumps through your shirt\\r\\nI can still feel your arms\\r\\nBut now Ill go sit on the floor\\r\\nWearing your clothes\\r\\nAll that I know is\\r\\nI dont know how to be something you miss\\r\\nI never thought wed have a last kiss\\r\\nNever imagined wed end like this\\r\\nYour name forever the name on my lips\\r\\nI do remember the swing of your step\\r\\nThe life of the party youre showing off again\\r\\nAnd I roll my eyes and then\\r\\nYou pull me in\\r\\nIm not much for dancing\\r\\nBut for you I did\\r\\nBecause I love your handshake meeting my father\\r\\nI love how you walk with your hands in your pockets\\r\\nHow you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something\\r\\nTheres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions\\r\\nBut now Ill go sit on the floor\\r\\nWearing your clothes\\r\\nAll that I know is\\r\\nI dont know how to be something you miss\\r\\nI never thought wed have a last kiss\\r\\nNever imagined wed end like this\\r\\nYour name forever the name on my lips\\r\\nSo Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep\\r\\nAnd I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe\\r\\nAnd I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are\\r\\nHope its nice where you are\\r\\nAnd I hope the sun shines\\r\\nAnd its a beautiful day\\r\\nAnd something reminds you\\r\\nYou wish you had stayed\\r\\nYou can plan for a change in weather and time\\r\\nBut I never planned on you changing your mind\\r\\nSo Ill go sit on the floor\\r\\nWearing your clothes\\r\\nAll that I know is\\r\\nI dont know how to be something you miss\\r\\nI never thought wed have a last kiss\\r\\nNever imagined wed end like this\\r\\nYour name forever the name on my lips\\r\\nJust like our last kiss\\r\\nForever the name on my lips\\r\\nForever the name on my lips\\r\\nJust like our last\\r\\nI said remember this moment in the back of my mind\\r\\nThe time we stood with our shaking hands\\r\\nThe crowds in the stands went wild\\r\\nWe were the Kings and the Queens\\r\\nAnd they read off our names\\r\\nThe night you danced like you knew our lives\\r\\nWould never be the same\\r\\nYou held your head like a hero\\r\\nOn a history book page\\r\\nIt was the end of a decade\\r\\nBut the start of an age\\r\\nLong live the walls we crashed through\\r\\nAll the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\\r\\nI was screaming long live all the magic we made\\r\\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\\r\\nOne day we will be remembered\\r\\nI said remember this feeling\\r\\nI passed the pictures around\\r\\nOf all the years that we stood there\\r\\nOn the sidelines wishing for right now\\r\\nWe are the Kings and the Queens\\r\\nYou traded your baseball cap for a crown\\r\\nWhen they gave us our trophies\\r\\nAnd we held them up for our town\\r\\nAnd the cynics were outraged\\r\\nScreaming this is absurd\\r\\nCause for a moment a band of thieves\\r\\nIn ripped up jeans got to rule the world\\r\\nLong live the walls we crashed through\\r\\nAll the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\\r\\nI was screaming long live all the magic we made\\r\\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\\r\\nIm not afraid\\r\\nLong live all the mountains we moved\\r\\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\\r\\nI was screaming long live that look on your face\\r\\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\\r\\nOne day we will be remembered\\r\\nHold on to spinning around\\r\\nConfetti falls to the ground\\r\\nMay these memories break our fall\\r\\nWill you take a moment\\r\\nPromise me this\\r\\nThat youll stand by me forever\\r\\nBut if God forbid fate should step in\\r\\nAnd force us into a goodbye\\r\\nIf you have children some day\\r\\nWhen they point to the pictures\\r\\nPlease tell them my name\\r\\nTell them how the crowds went wild\\r\\nTell them how I hope they shine\\r\\nLong live the walls we crashed through\\r\\nI had the time of my life with you\\r\\nLong long live the walls we crashed through\\r\\nAll the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\\r\\nI was screaming long live all the magic we made\\r\\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\\r\\nIm not afraid\\r\\nSinging long live all the mountains we moved\\r\\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\\r\\nAnd long long live that look on your face\\r\\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\\r\\nOne day we will be remembered\\r\\nElevator buttons and morning air\\r\\nStrangers silence makes me want to take the stairs\\r\\nIf you were here wed laugh about their vacant stares\\r\\nBut right now my time is theirs\\r\\nSeems like theres always someone who disapproves\\r\\nTheyll judge it like they know about me and you\\r\\nAnd the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do\\r\\nThe jurys out but my choice is you\\r\\nSo dont you worry your pretty little mind\\r\\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\\r\\nAnd life makes love look hard\\r\\nThe stakes are high the waters rough\\r\\nBut this love is ours\\r\\nYou never know what people have up their sleeves\\r\\nGhosts from your past gonna jump out at me\\r\\nLurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles\\r\\nBut I dont care cause right now youre mine\\r\\nAnd youll say\\r\\nDont you worry your pretty little mind\\r\\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\\r\\nAnd life makes love look hard\\r\\nThe stakes are high the waters rough\\r\\nBut this love is ours\\r\\nAnd its not theirs to speculate if its wrong\\r\\nAnd your hands are tough but they are where mine belong\\r\\nAnd Ill fight their doubt and give you faith\\r\\nWith this song for you\\r\\nCause I love the gap between your teeth\\r\\nAnd I love the riddles that you speak\\r\\nAnd any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored\\r\\nCause my heart is yours\\r\\nSo dont you worry your pretty little mind\\r\\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\\r\\nAnd life makes love look hard\\r\\nDont you worry your pretty little mind\\r\\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\\r\\nBut they cant take whats ours\\r\\nThey cant take whats ours\\r\\nThe stakes are high the waters rough\\r\\nBut this love is ours\\r\\nLast night I heard my own heart beating\\r\\nSounded like footsteps on my stairs\\r\\nSix months gone and Im still reaching\\r\\nEven though I know youre not there\\r\\nI was playing back a thousand memories baby\\r\\nThinkin bout everything weve been through\\r\\nMaybe Ive been going back too much lately\\r\\nWhen time stood still and I had you\\r\\nCome back come back come back to me like\\r\\nYou would you would if this was a movie\\r\\nStand in the rain outside till I came out\\r\\nCome back come back come back to me like\\r\\nYou could you could if you just said youre sorry\\r\\nI know that we could work it out somehow\\r\\nBut if this was a movie youd be here by now\\r\\nI know people change and these things happen\\r\\nBut I remember how it was back then\\r\\nWrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing\\r\\nCause nothing like this ever happened to them\\r\\nNow Im pacing down the hall chasing down your street\\r\\nFlashback to the night when you said to me\\r\\nNothings gonna change not for me and you\\r\\nNot before I knew how much I had to lose\\r\\nCome back come back come back to me like\\r\\nYou would you would if this was a movie\\r\\nStand in the rain outside till I came out\\r\\nCome back come back come back to me like\\r\\nYou could you could if you just said youre sorry\\r\\nI know that we could work it out somehow\\r\\nBut if this was a movie youd be here by now\\r\\nIf youre out there if youre somewhere if youre moving on\\r\\nIve been waiting for you ever since youve been gone\\r\\nI just want it back the way it was before\\r\\nAnd I just want to see you back at my front door\\r\\nAnd I say Come back come back come back to me like\\r\\nYou would before you said its not that easy\\r\\nBefore the fight before I locked you out\\r\\nBut I take it all back now\\r\\nCome back come back come back to me like\\r\\nYou would you would if this was a movie\\r\\nStand in the rain outside till I came out\\r\\nCome back come back come back to me like\\r\\nYou could you could if you just said youre sorry\\r\\nI know that we could work it out somehow\\r\\nBut if this was a movie youd be here by now\\r\\nYoud be here by now\\r\\nIts not the kind of ending you want to see now\\r\\nBaby what about the ending\\r\\nOh I thought youd be here by now\\r\\nThought youd be here by now\\r\\nTall dark and superman\\r\\nHe puts papers in his briefcase and drives away\\r\\nTo save the world or go to work\\r\\nIts the same thing to me\\r\\nHes got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition\\r\\nI wonder if he knows how much that I miss him\\r\\nI hang on every word you say yay\\r\\nAnd you smile and say How are you\\r\\nI say Just fine\\r\\nI always forget to tell you I love you I love you forever\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nYouve got a busy day today\\r\\nGo save the world Ill be around\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nCome back Ill be with you someday\\r\\nIll be right here on the ground\\r\\nWhen you come back down\\r\\nTall dark and beautiful\\r\\nHes complicated hes irrational\\r\\nBut I hope someday youll take me away and save the day yeah\\r\\nSomething in his deep brown eyes has me sayin\\r\\nHes not all bad like his reputation\\r\\nAnd I cant hear one single word they say\\r\\nAnd youll leave got places to be and Ill be OK\\r\\nI always forget to tell you I love you I loved you from the very first day\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nYouve got a busy day today\\r\\nGo save the world Ill be around\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nCome back Ill be with you someday\\r\\nIll be right here on the ground\\r\\nWhen you come back down\\r\\nAnd I watch you fly around the world\\r\\nAnd I hope you dont save some other girl\\r\\nDont forget dont forget about me\\r\\nIm far away but I never let you go\\r\\nIm lovestruck and looking out the window\\r\\nDont forget dont forget where Ill be\\r\\nRight here wishing the flowers were from you\\r\\nWishing the card was from you\\r\\nWishing the call was from you\\r\\nCause I loved you from the very first day\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nYouve got a busy day today\\r\\nGo save the world Ill be around\\r\\nForever and ever here\\r\\nI watch superman fly away\\r\\nI swear Ill be with you someday\\r\\nIll be right here on the ground\\r\\nWhen you come back down\\r\\nLa la la la la la\\r\\nLa la la la la la\\r\\nWhen you come back down\\r\\nIm walking fast through the traffic lights\\r\\nBusy streets and busy lives\\r\\nAnd all we know is touch and go\\r\\nWe are alone with our changing minds\\r\\nWe fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time\\r\\nAnd I never saw you coming\\r\\nAnd Ill never be the same\\r\\nYou come around and the armor falls\\r\\nPierce the room like a cannon ball\\r\\nNow all we know is dont let go\\r\\nWe are alone just you and me\\r\\nUp in your room and our slates are clean\\r\\nJust twin fire signs four blue eyes\\r\\nSo you were never a saint\\r\\nAnd Ive loved in shades of wrong\\r\\nWe learn to live with the pain\\r\\nMosaic broken hearts\\r\\nBut this love is brave and wild\\r\\nAnd I never saw you coming\\r\\nAnd Ill never be the same\\r\\nThis is a state of grace\\r\\nThis is the worthwhile fight\\r\\nLove is a ruthless game\\r\\nUnless you play it good and right\\r\\nThese are the hands of fate\\r\\nYoure my Achilles heel\\r\\nThis is the golden age of something good\\r\\nAnd right and real\\r\\nAnd I never saw you coming\\r\\nAnd Ill never be the same\\r\\nAnd I never saw you coming\\r\\nAnd Ill never be the same\\r\\nThis is a state of grace\\r\\nThis is a worthwhile fight\\r\\nLove is a ruthless game\\r\\nUnless you play it good and right\\r\\nLoving him is like driving a new Maserati\\r\\nDown a deadend street\\r\\nFaster than the wind passionate as sin\\r\\nEnding so suddenly\\r\\nLoving him is like trying to change your mind\\r\\nOnce youre already flying through the free fall\\r\\nLike the colors in autumn so bright\\r\\nJust before they lose it all\\r\\nLosing him was blue like Id never known\\r\\nMissing him was dark grey all alone\\r\\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\\r\\nBut loving him was red\\r\\nTouching him was like realizing all you ever wanted\\r\\nWas right there in front of you\\r\\nMemorizing him was as easy as knowing\\r\\nAll the words to your old favorite song\\r\\nFighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword\\r\\nAnd realizing theres no right answer\\r\\nRegretting him was like wishing you never found out\\r\\nThat love could be that strong\\r\\nLosing him was blue like Id never known\\r\\nMissing him was dark grey all alone\\r\\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\\r\\nBut loving him was red\\r\\nRemembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes\\r\\nTell myself its time now gotta let go\\r\\nBut moving on from him is impossible\\r\\nWhen I still see it all in my head\\r\\nIn burning red\\r\\nLoving him was red\\r\\nLosing him was blue like Id never known\\r\\nMissing him was dark grey all alone\\r\\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\\r\\nBut loving him was red\\r\\nAnd thats why hes spinning round in my head\\r\\nComes back to me burning red\\r\\nYeah yeah\\r\\nHis love was like driving a new Maserati down a deadend street\\r\\nPut your lips close to mine\\r\\nAs long as they dont touch\\r\\nOut of focus eye to eye\\r\\nTill the gravitys too much\\r\\nAnd Ill do anything you say\\r\\nIf you say it with your hands\\r\\nAnd Id be smart to walk away\\r\\nBut youre quick sand\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nThis path is reckless\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nAnd I I I like it\\r\\nI cant decide if its a choice\\r\\nGetting swept away\\r\\nI hear the sound of my own voice\\r\\nAsking you to stay\\r\\nAnd all we are is skin and bone trained to get along\\r\\nForever going with the flow but youre friction\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nThis path is reckless\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nAnd I I I like it\\r\\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\\r\\nAnd I will get you get you alone\\r\\nYour name has echoed through my mind\\r\\nAnd I just think you should think you should know\\r\\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive\\r\\nAnd I will follow you follow you home follow you follow you home\\r\\nThis hope is treacherous\\r\\nThis daydream is dangerous\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nAnd III III III\\r\\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\\r\\nAnd I will get you get you alone\\r\\nYour name has echoed through my mind\\r\\nAnd I just think you should think you should know\\r\\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive\\r\\nAnd I will follow you follow you home follow you follow you home\\r\\nThis hope is treacherous\\r\\nThis daydream is dangerous\\r\\nThis hope is treacherous\\r\\nIII III III \\r\\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night\\r\\nAnd I will

home follow you follow you home\\r\\nIll follow you follow you home follow you follow you home\\r\\nThis slope is treacherous\\r\\nAnd III like it\\r\\nOnce upon a time a few mistakes ago\\r\\nI was in your sights you got me alone\\r\\nYou found me you found me you found me\\r\\nI guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that\\r\\nAnd when I fell hard you took a step back\\r\\nWithout me without me without me\\r\\nAnd hes long gone when hes next to me\\r\\nAnd I realize the blame is on me\\r\\nCause I knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places Id never been\\r\\nTill you put me down oh\\r\\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places Id never been\\r\\nNow Im lying on the cold hard ground\\r\\nOh

drowning\\r\\nYoure drowning\\r\\nAnd I heard you moved on from whispers on the street\\r\\nA new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be\\r\\nAnd now I see now I see\\r\\nNow I see\\r\\nHe was long gone when he met me\\r\\nAnd I realize the joke is on me hey\\r\\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places Id never been\\r\\nTill you put me down oh\\r\\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places Id never been\\r\\nNow Im lying on the cold hard ground\\r\\nOh oh\\r\\nTrouble trouble trouble\\r\\nOh oh\\r\\nTrouble trouble trouble\\r\\nAnd the saddest fear comes creeping in\\r\\nThat you never loved me\\r\\nOr her or anyone or anything yeah\\r\\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places Id never been\\r\\nTill you put me down oh\\r\\nI knew you were trouble when you walked in\\r\\nSo shame on me now\\r\\nFlew me to places Id never been\\r\\nNow Im lying on the cold hard ground\\r\\nOh oh\\r\\nTrouble trouble trouble\\r\\nOh oh\\r\\nTrouble trouble trouble\\r\\nI walked through the door with you the air was cold\\r\\nBut something bout it felt like home somehow and I\\r\\nLeft my scarf there at your sisters house\\r\\nAnd youve still got it in your drawer even now\\r\\nOh your sweet disposition\\r\\nAnd my wideeyed gaze\\r\\nWere singing in a car getting lost Upstate\\r\\nThe autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\\r\\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\\r\\nAnd I know its long gone and that magics not here no more\\r\\nAnd I might be okay but Im not fine at all\\r\\nCause there we are again on that little town street\\r\\nYou almost ran the red cause you were looking over at me\\r\\nWind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well\\r\\nPhoto album on the counter\\r\\nYour cheeks were turning red\\r\\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed\\r\\nAnd your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee ball team\\r\\nYou taught me about your past thinking your future was me\\r\\nAnd I know its long gone and there was nothing else I could do\\r\\nAnd I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to\\r\\nCause there we are again in the middle of the night\\r\\nWere dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\\r\\nDown the stairs I was there I remember it all too well yeah\\r\\nAnd maybe we got lost in translation\\r\\nMaybe I asked for too much\\r\\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\\r\\nTill you tore it all up\\r\\nRunning scared I was there I remember it all too well\\r\\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\\r\\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\\r\\nIm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\\r\\nCause I remember it all all all too well\\r\\nTime wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it\\r\\nId like to be my old self again\\r\\nBut Im still trying to find it\\r\\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\\r\\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\\r\\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\\r\\nCause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\\r\\nYou cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah\\r\\nBecause there we are again when I loved you so\\r\\nBack before you lost the one real thing youve ever known\\r\\nIt was rare I was there I remember it all too well\\r\\nWind in my hair you were there you remember it all\\r\\nDown the stairs you were there you remember it all\\r\\nIt was rare I was there I remember it all too well\\r\\nIt feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters\\r\\nAnd make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh\\r\\nIt feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight\\r\\nTo fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh\\r\\nYeah\\r\\nWere happy free confused and lonely at the same time\\r\\nIts miserable and magical oh yeah\\r\\nTonights the night when we

Swift anyway Ew\\r\\nIt seems like one of those nights\\r\\nWe ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming\\r\\nInstead of sleeping\\r\\nYeah\\r\\nWere happy free confused and lonely in the best way\\r\\nIts miserable and magical oh yeah\\r\\nTonights the night when we forget about\\r\\nThe heartbreaks its time\\r\\nOh oh\\r\\nI dont know about you but Im feeling 22\\r\\nEverything will be

joke wed made\\r\\nAnd that was the first day\\r\\nAnd darling it was good never looking down\\r\\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground\\r\\nSpinning like a girl in a brand new dress\\r\\nWe had this big wide city all to ourselves\\r\\nWe blocked the noise with the sound of I need you\\r\\nAnd for the first time I had something to lose\\r\\nAnd I guess we fell apart in the usual way\\r\\nAnd the storys got dust on every page\\r\\nBut sometimes I wonder how you think about it now\\r\\nAnd I see your face in every crowd\\r\\nCause darling it was good never looking down\\r\\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground\\r\\nTonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through\\r\\nBut I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you\\r\\nTonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room\\r\\nBut I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you\\r\\nIt was good never looking down\\r\\nAnd right there where we stood was holy ground\\r\\nTonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through\\r\\nBut I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you\\r\\nTonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room\\r\\nBut I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you\\r\\nLong handwritten note deep in your pocket\\r\\nWords how little they mean when youre a little too late\\r\\nI stood right by the tracks your face in a locket\\r\\nGood girls hopeful theyll be and long they will wait\\r\\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\\r\\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\\r\\nIn dreams I meet you in warm conversation\\r\\nWe both wake in lonely beds different cities\\r\\nAnd time is taking its sweet time erasing you\\r\\nAnd youve got your demons and darling they all look like me\\r\\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\\r\\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\\r\\nDistance timing breakdown fighting\\r\\nSilence the train runs off its tracks\\r\\nKiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen\\r\\nHang up give up and for the life of us we cant get back\\r\\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\\r\\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\\r\\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\\r\\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\\r\\nWe had a beautiful magic love there\\r\\nWhat a sad beautiful tragic love affair\\r\\nNew to town with a made up name\\r\\nIn the angel city chasing fortune and fame\\r\\nAnd the camera flashes make it look like a dream\\r\\nYou had it figured out since you were in school\\r\\nEverybody loves pretty everybody loves cool\\r\\nSo overnight you look like a sixties queen\\r\\nAnother name goes up in lights like diamonds in the sky\\r\\nAnd theyll tell you now youre the lucky one\\r\\nYeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one\\r\\nBut can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh\\r\\nNow its big black cars and Riviera views\\r\\nAnd your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you\\r\\nAnd your secrets end up splashed on the news front page\\r\\nAnd they tell you that youre lucky\\r\\nBut youre so confused\\r\\nCause you dont feel pretty you just feel used\\r\\nAnd all the young things line up to take your place\\r\\nAnother name goes up in lights\\r\\nYou wonder if youll make it out alive\\r\\nAnd theyll tell you now youre the lucky one\\r\\nYeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one\\r\\nBut can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh\\r\\nIt was a few years later I showed up here\\r\\nAnd they still tell the legend of how you disappeared\\r\\nHow you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out\\r\\nThey say you bought a bunch of land somewhere\\r\\nChose a rose garden over Madison Square\\r\\nAnd it took some time but I understand it now\\r\\nCause now my name is up in lights but I think you got it right\\r\\nLet me tell you now youre the lucky one\\r\\nLet me tell you now youre the lucky one\\r\\nLet me tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh\\r\\nAnd theyll tell you now youre the lucky one\\r\\nYeah theyll tell you now

marvelous tune\\r\\nIt was the best night never would forget how we moved\\r\\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines\\r\\nAnd we were dancing dancing\\r\\nLike were made of starlight\\r\\nLike were made of starlight\\r\\nI met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45\\r\\nPicked me up late one night at the window\\r\\nWe were 17 and crazy running wild wild\\r\\nCant remember what song it was playing when we walked in\\r\\nThe night we snuck into a yacht club party\\r\\nPretending to be a duchess and a prince\\r\\nAnd I said Oh my what a marvelous tune\\r\\nIt was the best night never would forget how we moved\\r\\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines\\r\\nAnd we were dancing dancing\\r\\nLike were made of starlight starlight\\r\\nLike were made of starlight starlight\\r\\nHe said Look at you worrying too much about things you cant change\\r\\nYoull spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way\\r\\nHe was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me\\r\\nDont you see the starlight starlight\\r\\nDont you dream impossible things\\r\\nLike Oh my what a marvelous tune\\r\\nIt was the best night never would forget how we moved\\r\\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines\\r\\nAnd we were dancing dancing\\r\\nLike were made of starlight starlight\\r\\nLike were made of starlight starlight\\r\\nOoh ooh hes talking crazy\\r\\nOoh ooh dancing with me\\r\\nOoh ooh we could get married\\r\\nHave ten kids and teach em how to dream\\r\\nOh my what a marvelous tune\\r\\nIt was the best night never would forget how we moved\\r\\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines\\r\\nAnd we were dancing dancing\\r\\nLike were made of starlight starlight\\r\\nLike were made of starlight starlight\\r\\nLike were made of starlight starlight\\r\\nLike we dream impossible dreams\\r\\nLike starlight starlight\\r\\nLike we dream impossible dreams\\r\\nDont you see the starlight starlight\\r\\nDont you dream impossible things\\r\\nTook a deep breath in the mirror\\r\\nHe didnt like it when I wore high heels\\r\\nBut I do\\r\\nTurn the lock and put my headphones on\\r\\nHe always said he didnt get this song but I do I do\\r\\nWalked in expecting youd be late\\r\\nBut you got here early and you stand and wave\\r\\nI walk to you\\r\\nYou pull my chair out and help me in\\r\\nAnd you dont know how nice that is but I do\\r\\nAnd you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\\r\\nI think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did\\r\\nIve been spending the last eight months\\r\\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\\r\\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\\r\\nYou said you never met one girl who\\r\\nHad as many James Taylor records as you\\r\\nBut I do\\r\\nWe tell stories and you dont know why Im coming off a little shy\\r\\nBut I do\\r\\nAnd you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\\r\\nI think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did\\r\\nIve been spending the last eight months\\r\\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\\r\\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\\r\\nAnd we walked down the block to my car\\r\\nAnd I almost brought him up\\r\\nBut you start to talk about the movies\\r\\nThat your family watches every single Christmas\\r\\nAnd I want to talk about that\\r\\nAnd for the first time whats past is past\\r\\nCause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\\r\\nI think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did\\r\\nIve been spending the last eight months\\r\\nThinking all love ever does is break and burn and end\\r\\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\\r\\nBut on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again\\r\\nYou shouldve been there\\r\\nShouldve burst through the door\\r\\nWith that baby Im right here smile\\r\\nAnd it wouldve felt like\\r\\nA million little shining stars had just aligned\\r\\nAnd I wouldve been so happy\\r\\nChristmas lights glisten\\r\\nIve got my eye on the door\\r\\nJust waiting for you to walk in\\r\\nBut the time is ticking\\r\\nPeople ask me how Ive been\\r\\nAs I comb back through my memory\\r\\nHow you said youd be here\\r\\nYou said youd be here\\r\\nAnd it was like slow motion\\r\\nStanding there in my party dress\\r\\nIn red lipstick\\r\\nWith no one to impress\\r\\nAnd theyre all laughing\\r\\nAs Im looking around the room\\r\\nBut there was one thing missing\\r\\nAnd that was the moment I knew\\r\\nAnd the hours pass by\\r\\nNow I just wanna be alone\\r\\nBut your close friends always seem to know\\r\\nWhen theres something really wrong\\r\\nSo they follow me down the hall\\r\\nAnd there in the bathroom\\r\\nI try not to fall apart\\r\\nAnd the sinking feeling starts\\r\\nAs I say hopelessly\\r\\nHe said hed be here\\r\\nAnd it was like slow motion\\r\\nStanding there in my party dress\\r\\nIn red lipstick\\r\\nWith no one to impress\\r\\nAnd theyre all laughing\\r\\nAnd asking me about you\\r\\nBut there was one thing missing\\r\\nAnd that was the moment I knew\\r\\nWhat do you say\\r\\nWhen tears are streaming down your face\\r\\nIn front of everyone you know\\r\\nAnd what do you do when the one\\r\\nWho means the most to you\\r\\nIs the one who didnt show\\r\\nYou shouldve been here\\r\\nAnd I wouldve been so happy\\r\\nAnd it was like slow motion\\r\\nStanding there in my party dress\\r\\nIn red lipstick\\r\\nWith no one to impress\\r\\nAnd theyre all standing around me singing\\r\\nHappy birthday to you\\r\\nBut there was one thing missing\\r\\nAnd that was the moment I knew\\r\\nOhohohohohohohohohohohoh\\r\\nI knew\\r\\nOhohohohohohohohohohohoh\\r\\nYou call me later\\r\\nAnd said Im sorry I didnt make it\\r\\nAnd I said Im sorry too\\r\\nAnd that was the moment I knew\\r\\nYou said it in a simple way\\r\\n4 AM the second day\\r\\nHow strange that I dont know you at all\\r\\nStumbled through the long goodbye\\r\\nOne last kiss then catch your flight\\r\\nRight when I was just about to fall\\r\\nI told myself dont get attached\\r\\nBut in my mind I play it back\\r\\nSpinning faster than the plane that took you\\r\\nAnd this is when the feeling sinks in\\r\\nI dont wanna miss you like this\\r\\nCome back be here come back be here\\r\\nI guess youre in New York today\\r\\nI dont wanna need you this way\\r\\nCome back be here come back be here\\r\\nThe delicate beginning rush\\r\\nThe feeling you can know so much\\r\\nWithout knowing anything at all\\r\\nAnd now that I can put this down\\r\\nIf I had known what Id known now\\r\\nI never would have played so nonchalant\\r\\nTaxi cabs and busy streets\\r\\nThat never bring you back to me\\r\\nI cant help but wish you took me with you\\r\\nAnd this is when the feeling sinks in\\r\\nI dont wanna miss you like this\\r\\nCome back be here come back be here\\r\\nI guess youre in London today\\r\\nI dont wanna need you this way\\r\\nCome back be here come back be here\\r\\nThis is falling in love in the cruelest way\\r\\nThis is falling for you and you are worlds away\\r\\nNew York be here\\r\\nBut youre in London and I break down\\r\\nCause its not fair that youre not around\\r\\nI dont wanna miss you like this\\r\\nCome back be here\\r\\nCome back be here\\r\\nDont look at me you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that everybody knows that\\r\\nDont look at me you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that everybody knows that\\r\\nI dont even know her\\r\\nBut I feel a responsibility to do whats upstanding and right\\r\\nIts kinda like a code yeah\\r\\nAnd youve been getting closer and closer\\r\\nAnd crossing so many lines\\r\\nAnd it would be a fine proposition\\r\\nIf I was a stupid girl\\r\\nBut honey I am no ones exception\\r\\nThis I have previously learned\\r\\nSo dont look at me you got a girl at home\\r\\nAnd everybody knows that everybody knows that\\r\\nDont look

newest thing\\r\\nAnd take for granted what you have\\r\\nAnd it would be a fine proposition\\r\\nIf I was a stupid girl\\r\\nAnd yeah I might go with it\\r\\nIf I hadnt once been just like
